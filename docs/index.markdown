title: How to Generate Alt Text Using Gemini
---

## **Introduction**
Alt text, short for alternative text, is a descriptive attribute added to images on web pages. It serves as a textual representation of the image content, providing context and information for those who cannot view the images, particularly the visually impaired. When a visually impaired person uses a screen reader to browse a webpage, the alt text is read aloud, enabling them to understand the content of the images. On a webpage, alt text appears as a brief, concise description embedded within the HTML code alongside the image element, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in web design and content.
