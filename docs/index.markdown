title: How to Generate Alt Text Using Gemini
---

## **Introduction**
Alt text, short for alternative text, is a descriptive attribute added to images on web pages. It serves as a textual representation of the image content, providing context and information for those who cannot view the images, particularly the visually impaired. When a visually impaired person uses a screen reader to browse a webpage, the alt text is read aloud, enabling them to understand the content of the images. On a webpage, alt text appears as a brief, concise description embedded within the HTML code alongside the image element, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in web design and content.

## **Alt Text Guidelines**
There are a number of accepted best practices to creating alt text. Following each of these guidelines will ensure that the alt text you generate is descriptive, concise, and clear to aid the visually impaired in comprehension.
- Do not begin alt text with "image of" or "picture of" since a screen reader will already tell the reader an image is being described.
- Keep descriptions short and concise, and mark any images that do not convey information as a decorative image.
- Include any text in the image in your description.
- For complex images such as graphs or charts, include a brief alt text that describes the basic properties of the image, followed by a long description that explains the essential information communicated by the image.
- Make sure to pay attention to the context of your webpage when building alt text.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**
1. Go to [Google Gemini](gemini.google.com) and sign in or create an account. Gemini Advanced is not required to generate alt text, but may help to create better descriptions.

5. Await the reply. Once you receive the generated alt text, you may continue to provide more instructions in order to create a better suited description, or add this alt text description to your website.
